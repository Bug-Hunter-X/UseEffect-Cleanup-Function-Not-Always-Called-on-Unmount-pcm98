# React useEffect Cleanup Function Not Always Called on Unmount

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook is not always called when the component unmounts.  This can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior if the cleanup function is responsible for releasing resources.

## Problem

In some circumstances, especially when components mount and unmount rapidly or during complex state transitions, the cleanup function might not execute reliably.  The provided example showcases such a potential issue.

## Solution

The solution addresses the potential race condition by ensuring the cleanup function is properly triggered. The precise solution may vary depending on the root cause, but careful handling of state and asynchronous operations is crucial.
